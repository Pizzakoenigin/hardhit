On this record the two vocalists complement each other. They change between high singing and deep gutturals. The song Neuromancer has a beautiful acoustic guitar intro. It gets played again for the remarkable midpart of the song. I admire the talent of guitarist Christos Antoniou, who studied composition. He arranged all these beautiful orchestral parts."
